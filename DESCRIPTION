Description: Nonparametric (and semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. This package is a parallel implementation of the np package based on the MPI specification that incorporates the Rmpi package (Hao Yu <hyu@stats.uwo.ca>) with minor modifications and we are extremely grateful to Hao Yu for his contributions to the R community. We would like to gratefully acknowledge support from  the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC:www.nserc.ca), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC:www.sshrc.ca), and the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET:www.sharcnet.ca).
