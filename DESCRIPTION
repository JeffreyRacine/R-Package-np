Description: Nonparametric (and semiparametric) kernel methods that seamlessly handle a mix of continuous, unordered, and ordered factor data types. We would like to gratefully acknowledge support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC, <https://www.nserc-crsng.gc.ca/>), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC, <https://www.sshrc-crsh.gc.ca/>), and the Shared Hierarchical Academic Research Computing Network (SHARCNET, <https://sharcnet.ca/>). We would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the GNU GSL authors. In particular, we adapt the GNU GSL B-spline routine gsl_bspline.c adding automated support for quantile knots (in addition to uniform knots), providing missing functionality for derivatives, and for extending the splines beyond their endpoints.
