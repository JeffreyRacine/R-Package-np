# Benchmarks Layout

This directory is split by purpose:

- `perf/`: performance benchmarks and timing harnesses.
- `validation/`: correctness/parity probes and option sweeps.
- `common/`: shared helpers used by benchmark scripts.

Legacy method-specific benchmark folders are retained for continuity.
