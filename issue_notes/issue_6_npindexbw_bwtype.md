# Issue #6: bwtype support in npindexbw / npindex

**Status:** Resolved (ae9e41c)

## Fix
Pass `bwtype` through when rebuilding `sibandwidth` in `npindexbw.sibandwidth`, and document in `np.singleindex.bw.Rd`.

## Suggested GitHub response
Confirm support for `fixed`, `generalized_nn`, `adaptive_nn` consistent with npregbw.
