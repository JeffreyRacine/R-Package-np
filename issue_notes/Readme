Resolved / Implemented (in ae9e41c)

#4 (npcdensbw cv.ls → cv.ml segfault)
Fixed by resetting conditional-density externals in C before each call (prevents stale pointers).
#6 (bwtype option for npindexbw/npindex)
Passed through + documented in .Rd.
#7 (uocquantile with factor subset)
Fixed by dropping unused levels before mode selection.
#13 (npudens variance for categorical only)
Corrected variance to p(1−p)/n.
#5 (npqreg tau validity)
Added validation for tau ∈ (0,1).
#26 (stored/dynamic formula parsing)
explodePipe() evaluates formula to handle stored calls.
#51 (npregiv with exogenous w)
Vector‑safe derivative check (length‑safe conditional).
#18 (Tikhonov multi‑instrument)
Fixed p handling so multi‑dim instruments work.
#50 (np.pairs / np.pairs.plot)
Added functions + docs + NAMESPACE export.
Docs updated for bwtype in semiparametric .Rd (plregression/smoothcoef/singleindex).
Investigated but not kept (reverted)

#44 (Bvcov in npindex.sibandwidth)
Reverted — regression risk; left for co‑author.
#3 (local linear + higher‑order kernels)
Explored multiple stabilizers; nothing clean. Left as “possibly feature, not bug.”
Still open / not fully addressed

#10 (npcdens gradients abort)
Not reproducible in your latest test.
#16 (npregbw rule of thumb)
Concluded not feasible in general; guidance only.
#18 now fixed (see above).
#44 open (needs deeper theoretical check).
#3 open (behavior likely inherent to higher‑order kernel LL).
