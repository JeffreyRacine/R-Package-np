## Issue Mapping (Best-Effort)

The following issues appear to be addressed by changes in this tree:

- `#4` (npcdensbw cv.ls -> cv.ml segfault): addressed in C/R core updates (see `src/np.c` and related bandwidth logic).
- `#6` (npindexbw bwtype option): addressed in `R/np.singleindex.bw.R` and `R/np.singleindex.R`.
- `#7` (uocquantile subset of factor): addressed in `R/util.R`.
- `#13` (npudens categorical variance): addressed in `R/np.density.R`.
- `#18` (npregiv Tikhonov multi‑instrument): addressed in `R/npregiv.R`.
- `#50` (cross‑validated pairs plot): addressed by `R/np.pairs.R`.

If any of these are not fully resolved, treat this as a pointer to where the relevant changes landed.
