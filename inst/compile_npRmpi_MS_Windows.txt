   starts with the appropriate Rtools and R bin paths.

      typesmpd -install -phrase behappy

      change behappy to whatever the pass phrase you choose).

      Run smpd -status

      If it returns "smpd running on your_host_name", then smpd is
      setup properly.

       “wmpiregister” and enter your PC username and password (the one
       you use to log in).

       typesmpd -install -phrase behappy

       change behappy to whatever the pass phrase you choose).

       Run smpd -status

   directory is correct.

       i. Go to “Start” -> “run” and type “cmd”. Then type
       “R”. ii. From inside R, run

       Install.packages(“cubature”)

3. Add MPICH bin directory to PATH environment variables as follows:

   a. Right click "My Computer" and choose "Properties". Click
   "Advanced system settings" to get a new window.  ￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼

   b. Click "Environment Variables..." to get a new window. Locate
   variable "PATH" (it is version dependent. Either User or System
   variables will be fine). Click Edit to get a new window.

   Files\MPICH\bin;" (Remove the

4. npRmpi Installation:

Go to “Start” -> “run” and type “cmd”. Navigate where item (e) in step

C:\Users\yourusername\Downloads” and write

R CMD INSTALL –preclean npRmpi_0.50-1.tar.gz

5. Testing:

From inside your DOS command shell, now navigate where your test R
code (called it “mytest.R”) is located (along with the .Rprofile
file). At the command prompt, write

mpiexec –n 2 R –no-save –q < mytest.R > mytest_OUT.txt

Open “mytest_OUT.txt” using notepad or any other text editor and check
it ran correctly.
